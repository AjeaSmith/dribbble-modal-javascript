### About the project
The goal for this project was to tap into some javascript. I wanted to start with something small and simple so I wouldn't get too discourage by the complexity. So, I decided to build a modal (which is a common component you see on websites). The animation was done using css. By default, the modal is hidden, and with some javascript I toggled between showing the modal with the button to using the close button within the modal to close it (`show_modal` class). Nothing to complex with this project but it was a good step for me into javascript. Side note, I got the modal design from dribbble and coded it from scratch. (no bootstrap or any other css framework used).
